# testing-practice

Test-driven development (TDD), is a an approach to development which emphasizes test-first development. it involves writing a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and then go on to refactor the code. In other words, TDD is one way to think through requirements or design before writing functional code. Another view is that TDD is a programming technique which helps  to write clean code that works.

This project involves writing various tests using Jest test-running systems available in JavaScript for functions and making sure those tests pass.
